# How to Contribute
Feel free to clone, modify, and submit a pull request.

To ensure quality and ease review, please do the following points:
* Do `cargo fmt` and `cargo check` to make sure your code
  is formatted and compiles without warnings, particularly with
  feature gates enabled/disabled.
* Make sure the example still works. If there are changes with the API,
  reflect that in the example.
* Rebasing is discouraged, as history is very, very important.
* Overly broad PRs will be rejected, unless there are specific needs.
